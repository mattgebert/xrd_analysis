# xrd_analysis
Github repo for my own XRD analysis functions.

### Crystal Spacing
Defined geometic inter-planar distances for various standard lattice types.

### Example 1:
`example_1.py` demonstrates how to use Bragg principles to calculate the various \theta corresponding to XRD analysis, then match them to experiment data.
